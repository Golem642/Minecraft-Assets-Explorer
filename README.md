# Minecraft Assets Explorer
This is a quick tool i made to naviguate throught the Minecraft assets for versions above 1.7.1, in which they became separated and renamed by hash

Also it's written in python because i was too lazy

Things to do for later :
- Compatibility between different OS
- UI ?
- Better error handling
- idfk

'ight leave me alone for now i fixed it ok, i'll come back to it in a few month maybe lmfao
